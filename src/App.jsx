              Hey there! My name is Kshitij Jagtap, and welcome to my static portfolio
              website. Here, I'd like to share a bit about myself, the projects I've
              worked on, and showcase some of the work I've put into developing these
              ideas. This website is part of a personal initiative I've been calling
              <span class='text-yellow-400'> "Project Ultimate" </span>â€”a collection of ideas and innovations that I aim to
              bring to life, starting with this very platform.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm excited to finally see this project take shape with the creation of
              this site. However, this is just the beginning. There are countless more
              ideas I want to implement, gradually building them into smaller,
              meaningful projects that will come together as a cohesive whole under
              the "Project Ultimate" banner. I hope to continuously evolve this space,
              incorporating new skills, fresh designs, and innovative solutions as I
              grow as a developer. Stay tuned for more updates as Project Ultimate
              unfolds!
